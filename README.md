Hardwire Design's first model. 

The Fusion-I blends traditional styles of electric guitar with complicated geometry achieved using modern CNC technology. Complete with Machined Aluminum plates in the Pickguard, Tremolo Cover, and Neck Plate. 

In designing this guitar I intended for it to be incredibly easy to work on, which is why I included threaded inserts in both the neck and the electronics cavity; to allow the use of machine screws which helps mitigate stripping the wood out. I also included magnets in the tremolo cover to allow it to be popped it off with a fingernail. This allows one to adjust the tremolo quickly and easily.Unlike a traditional S-type, the pickguard is not located under the strings, this allows work to be done on the electronics without restringing the guitar. As this is my first model, there are features that obviously could be improved and I may make changes as I develop better practices. As it stands the tolerances are quite tight between the main body and all the aluminum pieces, this was intended to leave room for large amounts of sanding but this could likely be increased.

Here is the Bill of Materials for the pictured build

The pictured build uses a Guitarfetish neck as I did not have a proper setup for milling necks at the time, will update with pictures after a neck is produced. The standard wiring is a Passive Treble & Bass control with One volume, one treble, and one bass pot. A visual wiring diagram from singlecoil.com is included in the files.
